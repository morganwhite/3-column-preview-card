## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mobile-first really is the way to go when building from scratch. It is easier to think about expanding something, rather than trying to squish a layout down after the fact.


### Continued development

Responsive componenets are still a challenge for me. I feel like there is a simple pattern for these parts of the site that I can return to over and over once I learn what it is. My biggest frustration is the transition from desktop to mobile layout. It could be smoother.
